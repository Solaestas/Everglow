[h1]Everglow Demo[/h1]

[h3]What is a demo?[/h3]
Demo stands for demonstration.
It means this version of mod is for demonstration purpose, 
instead of being played as a content mod.
You can get early access to part of the contents, 
but cannot have a relatively complete playthrough.

[h3]What is Everglow?[/h3]
Everglow is a comprehensive content mod, dedicated to add rich and interesting content into Terraria, which focuses on exploration, like every Terrarian did when playing this game for the first time.
These contents will cover all aspects of the game: from the Terraria Continent to a wider world, weapons, equipments, bosses, biomes, subworlds, and game mechanics.
With a unique module system, players can selectively load some modules to customize the mod content to a certain extent, and find their favorite way to play.
The content of the two mods, Eternal Resolve and MythMod, will each be partially migrated as a module, and may be linked to other mods in the future.
However, many of these features are not yet included in the demo, but will be eventually.
